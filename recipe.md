add 1 cup of all purpose flour in a bowl.
then add 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.
mix them well and set them aside.
take another bowl and add 1/2 cup of softened salted butter and then add the vanilla essence and red food colouring (1 teaspoon and 1 tablespoon respectively)
use a whisk to mix them well until you get a light and fluffy mixture.
then add the dry ingredients you had set aside earlier into the frothy mixture you made now.
after mixing them well you get a sandy mixture in which you add the buttermilk which is the most important part of the recipe.
in order to get the buttermilk take 3 tablespoons of milk and add 1 teaspoon of white vinegar / lime juice (as per availability) and leave it for 15 minutes until you see the curdles in it.
now add the buttermilk into your mixture and mix it well.
after combining the mixture put your dough into refridgerator for 30 minutes. this part is very important otherwise your cookie dough will spread a lot in the oven.
when you have kept the dough in for 15 minutes, preheat your oven for 15 minutes at 180 degree. 
 till the time your oven is preheating take your oven tray and cover it with silicon mat. if silicon mat is not available you can use 1 sheet of parchment paper or 2 sheets of aluminium foils.
 now take out the dough out from your fridge and size them into equal sized balls and put them in the oven for about 12 - 15 minutes.
 the trick here is that we don't add the chocolate chips now.
 we add them when the cookies are about to get baked completely , i.e, 5 minutes before the baking time is over and put the cookies for baking again after putting the chocolate chips for 5 minutes.
